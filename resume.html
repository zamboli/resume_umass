More Detailed Resume<br/><br/>
I consider the gaps in my educational history to be largely unexceptional. I worked and lived and survived. Behavior and perhaps impulsive decisions I have made, seen in hindsight, have been affected by depression; which has been an obstacle for me in persuing my interests. I have sought help for this in the past and may well still yet. I hope this helps you move your decision making process foward. Thanks again, for your time and consideration.

<p>
In the summer prior to leaving the School of Visual Arts I worked on a purse seiner fishing salmon around Larson Bay, AK.
</p>
<p>
Deciding to leave film school in 2006, I had some funds from fishing burning a hole in my pocket. I spent six months traveling in Central America between Panama and Mexico. Visiting friends in Nicaragua and working in an Italian restaurant in Costa Rica.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I made my way to visit my grandmother in San Diego. From there I took a job working as a cellarhand at Cakebread Cellars in Napa, California. The Cakebreads were fantastic employers. They treated their employees, both seasonal and full-time, just awesome. It was long days and hard work during "the crush" but also a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>
After thaaat, I went home for Thanksgiving. Promptly got restless, made a phone call, and took a job working at a pizza place on the ski slopes at Telluride, CO. My sister, also having taken a leave from university, had taken a job as a chef in nearby Utah. When the season ended in Spring we decided to go to Portland, OR where she currently remains.
</p>
<p>
Whilst in Portland the economy quickly started to go down the tubes. I found myself in a position having difficulty finding work and affordable places to live; Competing with the masses of tattooed 20-somethings who reside there. I worked some temp jobs such as working a 2:30AM shift at a bakery. Making donuts.
</p>
<p>
I decided to apply for the architecture program at the University of Oregon and attended Portland State Univerity to gain some basic Maths and flesh out my art portfolio for admission to UO. While I was eventually admitted and enrolled, I decided to defer my admission pending residency status in Oregon. During such time I suppose I fell into a funk; not knowing many people in the area (Eugene, OR) and feeling pessemistic about the outlook of architecture and building in the economy.
</p>
<p>
A good childhood friend of mine was in California. I headed out there naively thinking I could always go back to Eugene, which I did not. California was lovely except for that I was generally depressed. I worked some odd jobs such as landscaping, and helping out on a friend's farm, but suffering from bouts of unemployment, I was not feeling particularly productive. I don't regret it but don't regard it as time very well spent.
</p>
<p>
Then home again, where I worked at a bicycle shop during the summer. Then a ski area again, this time in Lake Placid, NY where I worked on the chair lifts.
</p>
<p>
In Lake Placid I starting seriously considering education again. I was looking at a new 12 week programming school that seemed to promise an awful lot, but it seemed like they are churning out graduates as fast as possible with a fairly narrow skill set. A university setting has much more robust offerings in areas I'm interested in: networking and machine learning. I'm excited about the possibilities.
